## Phone to Note to Obsidian

This is a Phone to Note (https://phonetonote.com) client for Obsidian
(https://obsidian.md). Phone to Note allows sending notes to your note-keeping
software via SMS, Telegram, email, and a few other integrations.

The plugin will periodically (one per minute) fetch new notes from Phone to Note
and append them to the Daily Note of the day that the message was sent.

### Get raw text

Turn this on to get the exact text you sent to Phone to Note, without any of the
parsing and replacement of dates that Phone to Note normally performs.
