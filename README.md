## Phone to Roam to Obsidian

This is a Phone to Roam (https://www.phonetoroam.com) client for Obsidian
(https://obsidian.md). Phone to Roam allows sending notes to your note-keeping
software via SMS, Telegram, email, and a few other integrations.

The plugin will periodically fetch new notes from Phone to Roam and append them
to the Daily Note of the day that the message was sent.

Also adds a "Phone to Roam to Obsidian: Get new notes" command to force checking
for new notes immediately.

### Get raw text
